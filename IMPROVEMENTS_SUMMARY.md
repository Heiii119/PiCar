# Autopilot Training Improvements Summary

## Problems Identified from Training Graphs

Based on typical autopilot training issues shown in plots:

1. **Overfitting** - Training loss much lower than validation loss
2. **Poor convergence** - Losses not decreasing smoothly
3. **High error rates** - MAE too high, predictions inaccurate
4. **Unstable training** - Erratic loss curves
5. **Limited data** - Not enough samples for good generalization

## Solutions Implemented

### **1. Better Model Architecture (NVIDIA PilotNet-inspired)**

**Before:**

- 3 conv layers (16→32→64 filters)
- 1 dense layer (64 units)
- Simple architecture

**After:**

- 5 conv layers (24→36→48→64→64 filters)
- 3 dense layers (128→64→32 units)
- Batch normalization after each conv layer
- More dropout (30%, 30%, 20%)
- Better feature extraction capability

**Benefits:**

- More learning capacity
- Better feature learning
- More stable training
- Reduced internal covariate shift

### **2. Data Augmentation**

**New features:**

- Horizontal image flipping with steering inversion
- Random brightness adjustments (0.7-1.3x)
- Real-time augmentation during training
- Effectively doubles dataset size

**Benefits:**

- More diverse training data
- Better generalization
- Reduced overfitting
- Works well with limited data

### **3. Advanced Training Strategy**

**Improved settings:**

- Lower learning rate (5e-4 vs 1e-3) for smoother convergence
- Learning rate reduction on plateau (ReduceLROnPlateau)
- Early stopping with patience=10
- 85/15 train/val split (more training data)
- Model checkpointing (saves best model)

**Benefits:**

- Better convergence
- Finds better local minima
- Prevents overfitting
- Saves best model automatically

### **4. Comprehensive Monitoring**

**New callbacks:**

- **EarlyStopping** - Stops when no improvement
- **ReduceLROnPlateau** - Adapts learning rate
- **ModelCheckpoint** - Saves best model
- **TensorBoard** - Visual training monitoring
- **CSVLogger** - Detailed metrics logging

**Benefits:**

- Better training control
- Prevents overtraining
- Detailed performance analysis
- Visual feedback

### **5. Training Visualization**

**Automatic plot generation with 4 subplots:**

1. **Loss curve** (train vs val)
2. **MAE curve** (train vs val)
3. **Learning rate schedule**
4. **Overfitting check** (train-val gap)

**Benefits:**

- Easy diagnosis of problems
- Visual confirmation of good training
- Helps tune hyperparameters
- Professional documentation

### **6. Better Autopilot Control**

**New features:**

- Throttle scaling (0.5-1.0) for safety
- Steering smoothing (reduces oscillation)
- Auto-loads best model (not final)
- Emergency stop button
- Real-time status display
- Smooth mode switching

**Benefits:**

- Safer testing
- Smoother driving
- Better user control
- Easier debugging

### **7. Flexible Configuration**

**Interactive options:**

- Choose augmentation (yes/no)
- Choose model size (full/lightweight)
- Set epochs (default 50)
- Set batch size (default 32)
- Set throttle scale
- Enable/disable smoothing

**Benefits:**

- Adapt to your hardware
- Experiment with settings
- Quick prototyping
- Better user experience

## How to Use

### 1. Collect Better Data

Focus on:

- **Quality over quantity** (smooth driving)
- **Variety** (different scenarios)
- **Balance** (equal left/right turns)
- **Minimum 500 frames** (1000+ better)

### 2. Train with New Features

```bash
python autopilot_drive_train_picam2.py
# Choose option 1 or 4

# When training:
Use data augmentation? → YES
Use lightweight model? → NO
Number of epochs? → 50-100
Batch size? → 32
```

### 3. Monitor Training

Watch for:

- Smooth decreasing loss curves
- Train and val loss close together
- MAE < 0.2
- Early stopping triggers (means converged)

### 4. Test Autopilot

```bash
python autopilot_drive_train_picam2.py
# Choose option 3

# Configuration:
Use best model? → YES
Throttle scale? → 0.5 (start slow!)
Steering smoothing? → YES
```

### 5. Iterate

If results not good:

1. Collect more data (especially problem scenarios)
2. Train longer (100+ epochs)
3. Check data quality
4. Adjust throttle scale
5. Retrain with augmentation

## Troubleshooting

See `AUTOPILOT_TRAINING_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting.

Quick fixes:

- **Zigzagging** → Lower throttle, enable smoothing
- **Off track** → More data, train longer
- **High loss** → More data, augmentation
- **Slow training** → Use lightweight model
